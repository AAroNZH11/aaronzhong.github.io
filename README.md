# Welcome to Aaron's Site 👋

Hey there! I’m **Aaron Zhong**, currently studying **Biostatistics (Data Science)** at the **University of Washington, Seattle**.  
I enjoy working with data, building models, and turning messy datasets into something meaningful — or at least less confusing.  

When I’m not coding, you might find me biking around Seattle or trying out new recipes.
